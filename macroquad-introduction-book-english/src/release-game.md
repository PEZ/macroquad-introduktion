# Release your game

Now that you have made a complete game, you need to release it so that others
can play it. In the following chapters are instructions on how to build your
game for different platforms.

We'll start by looking at how to build and package the game for the most
common desktop platforms: Windows, MacOS, and Linux. After that is a chapter
on building the game to run on a web page. We will also look at how to build
and package the game for mobile platforms such as Android and iPhone.
