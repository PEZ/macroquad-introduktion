# The end

You have now developed and published a simple game written in the programming
language Rust and the game library Macroquad. However there is still a lot to
be done to make it into a complete game, but you should now have a solid
foundation to make the game into your own.

Here are some ideas on how to improve the game to make it more fun to play:

* Add more enemies with different movements and graphics.
* Allow enemies to shoot bullets themselves.
* Add levels with increasing difficulty.
* Upgrades that improve the weapon.
* Add big boss enemies at the end of levels.
* Extra lives
